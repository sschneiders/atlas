/// substring detector to vLLM's anchored-at-end algorithm (vLLM main
/// `v1/core/sched/utils.py::_has_repeating_pattern`, GitHub
/// vllm-project/vllm; verified identical in 0.17.0 + current main).
///
/// **Why**: Atlas's scan-anywhere algorithm fires on ANY period match
/// in the last 280 tokens — including OLD patterns the model has
/// already moved past. Manifests as false-positive cutoffs on
/// numbered lists ("Step 1: Step 2: Step 3: Verify Cargo.toml" has
/// period-2 in the [Step,N] tail BEFORE the prose continuation, so
/// Atlas would fire even though the model is no longer looping).
///
/// **vLLM's algorithm**: take the LAST `pattern_len` tokens as a fixed
/// anchor; check whether the preceding `(min_repeats - 1)` windows of
/// the same length are byte-identical to it. If yes, the model is
/// CURRENTLY in a loop of period `pattern_len`. False positives on
/// historic patterns disappear because the check is end-anchored.
///
/// **`scan_window` kept for signature compat** — unused now, since the
/// vLLM algorithm only reads the last `pattern_len * min_repeats`
/// tokens (bounded automatically).
